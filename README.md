# ELEGOO-UNO-R3-ROBOT

To-do:
* [x] Debug code changes made by Deandra
  * [x] AMR stuck in Stop() (until object is detected) even if flame is not detected anymore
  * [x] Fix line following algorithm, figure out why sometimes it doesn't follow lines properly
* [x] Object Avoidance
  * [x] Remove delays in object avoidance algorithm
  * [ ] Add 3 ultrasonic sensors to fix object detection blind spots
* [x] Flame Detection and Extinguishing
  * [x] Add 2 flame IR sensors OR attach 5-way flame sensor module to fix flame detection blind spots
  * [x] Attach fan (DC Motor + Propellor)
  * [x] Code logic for the fan (ON when middle == LOW, OFF when middle == HIGH) 
  * [x] Add ```maxFlameTurnDuration``` to prevent infinite donuts in flame detection mode
  * [x] Fix turning problem / wheel problem
* [ ] Defense Mechanism
  * [ ] Add space in the back of the chassis for our candle
  * [x] Figure out a defense mechanism to prevent getting eliminated by other AMRs
